### Top 10 React.js useMemo() Interview Questions

1. **What is the useMemo() hook in React.js?**  
   > It memoizes a computed value to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary recalculations.

2. **When should you use useMemo()?**  
   > Use it for expensive calculations or complex data transformations that don’t need to recompute on every render.

3. **How does useMemo() differ from useCallback()?**  
   > `useMemo()` memoizes a value, while useCallback() memoizes a function.

4. **What is the syntax of useMemo()?**  
   > ```js
   > const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
   > ```

5. **What happens if you omit the dependency array in useMemo()?**  
   > The memoized value recomputes on every render, defeating its purpose.

6. **Can useMemo() improve performance in all cases?**  
   > No, it’s only beneficial for computationally expensive operations; otherwise, it may add overhead.

7. **What types of values can useMemo() return?**  
   > It can return any value: primitives, objects, arrays, or functions.

8. **How does useMemo() handle dependency changes?**  
   > It recalculates the memoized value only when dependencies change.

9. **Can useMemo() be used to memoize JSX elements?**  
   > Yes, but it’s rare; use it for JSX when rendering is expensive and props are stable.

10. **What’s a common mistake when using useMemo()?**  
    > Overusing it for simple calculations, which can lead to unnecessary complexity and overhead.
