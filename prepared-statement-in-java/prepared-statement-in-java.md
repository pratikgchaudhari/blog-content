### Prepared Statement in Java

- **PreparedStatement** is a Java interface in the `java.sql` package, extending `Statement` for executing parameterized SQL queries.
- **Precompiled Queries**: SQL statements are precompiled and stored, improving performance for repeated executions.
- **Parameterized Queries**: Uses placeholders (`?`) for dynamic values, set via methods like `setInt()`, `setString()`, etc.
- **Prevents SQL Injection**: Automatically escapes special characters, enhancing security over raw SQL concatenation.
- **Improved Performance**: Reduces parsing overhead for repeated queries, as the database caches the execution plan.
- **Type-Safe Data Handling**: Ensures correct data types for parameters, reducing runtime errors.
- **Batch Execution**: Supports batch processing for executing multiple statements efficiently.
- **Close Resources**: Must be closed (e.g., `pstmt.close()`) to free database resources.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for dynamic queries, frequent executions, or when security is critical.
