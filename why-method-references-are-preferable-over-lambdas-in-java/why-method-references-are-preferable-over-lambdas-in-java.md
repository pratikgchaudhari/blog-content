### Why method references are preferable over lambdas in Java:

- Method references are more concise than equivalent lambdas.

- They eliminate boilerplate (parameters, arrows, braces).

- They improve readability by naming the exact method used.

- They act as self-documenting code with zero added explanation needed.

- They promote reuse of existing, well-tested methods.

- Changes to the target method propagate automatically.

- They enhance maintainability and refactoring support.

- They align with Java’s preference for named, composable behavior.

- They often result in cleaner, more scannable stream pipelines.

- Performance is usually identical or slightly better (invokedynamic).

- Use lambdas only when logic can’t be expressed by an existing method.
