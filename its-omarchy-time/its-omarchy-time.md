### It's Omarchy Time!

I decided to try DHH's Omarchy over the weekend, and I’m loving it!

I’ve used Linux before, specifically Ubuntu, but never stuck with it for long. It wasn’t because of any issues with the distro itself. Linux-based desktop operating systems just aren’t as common, especially for preinstalled software on desktops or laptops.

As a result, most people end up using either Windows, which can be frustrating, or Apple’s macOS, which pulls you into their ecosystem. After using these systems for a few years, it’s hard to break the habit.

Omarchy’s refreshing UI and fast performance might finally help me move away from these mainstream options. Soon, I hope to say those four magic words: “I use Arch, btw :)”

If you’re not glued to Tech Twitter (now called X) and haven’t heard of Omarchy or DHH, check out their website. It’s worth your time: https://omarchy.org
