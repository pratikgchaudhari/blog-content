2. **What is the syntax of `useOptimistic`?**
 > ```js
 > const [optimisticState, setOptimisticState] = useOptimistic(currentState, updateFn); 
 > ```

3. **What does the `updateFn` in `useOptimistic` do?**  
   > It computes the optimistic state based on the current state and an action/input.

4. **When should you use `useOptimistic`?**  
   > Use it for async operations like form submissions or likes to provide instant UI feedback.

5. **How does `useOptimistic` improve user experience?**  
   > It updates the UI immediately, making the app feel faster and more responsive.

6. **What happens if the server request fails with `useOptimistic`?**  
   > The UI can revert to the original state, and you handle errors manually (e.g., show a message).

7. **How is `useOptimistic` different from `useState`?**  
   > `useOptimistic` manages temporary, optimistic UI state for async operations, while `useState` manages general state.

8. **Is `useOptimistic` stable in React?**  
   > It’s stable in React 19.

9. **Can you use `useOptimistic` for a like button?**  
   > Yes, it can instantly show a "liked" state before the server confirms.

11. **What’s a key challenge when using `useOptimistic`?**  
    > Managing consistency between optimistic and actual state, especially on errors.

12. **Does `useOptimistic` automatically revert on failure?**  
    > No, you must manually handle reversion or error states.

13. **Can `useOptimistic` be used with server components?**  
    > It’s primarily for client-side optimistic updates, not directly with server components.

14. **What’s an example use case for `useOptimistic`?**  
    > Adding a comment to a list instantly before server confirmation.

15. **How do you handle temporary IDs in optimistic updates?**
