### `@ServletRegistration` & `@FilterRegistration` in Spring Boot 3.5

- **Purpose**: `@ServletRegistration` and `@FilterRegistration` are new annotations in Spring Boot 3.5.0 for programmatically registering servlets and filters in a Spring application, simplifying configuration compared to traditional bean-based or `web.xml` approaches.
- **Ease of Use**: Enable annotation-driven registration, reducing boilerplate code and making it easier to define servlets/filters directly in Java classes without manual `ServletContext` manipulation.
- **Servlet Registration**:
    - **Function**: `@ServletRegistration` registers a servlet with attributes like URL mappings, name, and init parameters.
    - **Use Case**: Ideal for adding custom servlets (e.g., legacy or third-party) in tests, prototypes, or apps requiring specific HTTP endpoints.
    - **Example**: Annotate a configuration class to register a servlet with specific URL patterns, streamlining integration in web applications.
- **Filter Registration**:
    - **Function**: `@FilterRegistration` registers a filter with attributes like URL patterns, servlet names, or dispatcher types.
    - **Use Case**: Useful for applying custom filters (e.g., logging, authentication) in testing or to modify request/response flows without complex configuration.
    - **Example**: Register a filter to intercept requests for specific paths, enhancing request processing in a declarative way.
- **Testing Benefits**: Simplify test setup by allowing quick servlet/filter registration in `@SpringBootTest` environments, reducing the need for full `WebApplicationContext` configuration.
- **Flexibility**: Support dynamic configuration, enabling conditional registration based on environment or profiles, improving modularity in multi-module projects.
- **Integration**: Work seamlessly with Spring Boot’s auto-configuration, complementing existing mechanisms like `ServletRegistrationBean` while offering a more concise, annotation-based alternative.
- **Significance in Development**: Enhance developer productivity by aligning with Spring’s convention-over-configuration philosophy, making it faster to prototype or extend web applications.
