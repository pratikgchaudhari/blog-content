### Top 10 considerations while designing Rate-Limiter in a System Design Interview

1. **Algorithm Selection**: Choose an appropriate rate-limiting algorithm based on requirements, such as Token Bucket (allows bursts), Leaky Bucket (smooths traffic), Fixed Window Counter (simple but has boundary issues), or Sliding Window Log (accurate but memory-intensive).

2. **Rate-Limiting Granularity**: Define the scope of the rate limit (e.g., per user, per IP, per API key, or global) to align with the system's needs, ensuring fair resource allocation and protection against abuse.

3. **Throughput and Quota Definition**: Specify the rate limit (e.g., 100 requests per minute) and ensure it balances system capacity, user experience, and protection from overuse or attacks.

4. **Scalability**: Design the rate-limiter to handle high traffic volumes, using distributed systems techniques like Redis or in-memory caches for fast, scalable storage of rate-limiting counters or logs.

5. **Distributed Systems Challenges**: Address issues in distributed environments, such as clock skew, data consistency, and synchronization across multiple nodes, using solutions like eventual consistency or centralized storage.

6. **Accuracy and Precision**: Ensure the rate-limiter accurately tracks requests, especially for algorithms like Sliding Window Log, which requires precise timestamps to avoid over- or under-limiting.

7. **Fault Tolerance**: Implement mechanisms to handle failures, such as fallback strategies or graceful degradation, to prevent the rate-limiter from becoming a single point of failure.

8. **Performance and Latency**: Optimize for low-latency checks, using in-memory stores like Redis or local caching to minimize overhead while processing requests.

9. **User Feedback and Handling**: Design clear responses for clients when limits are exceeded (e.g., HTTP 429 status code) and consider features like retry-after headers or informative error messages.

10. **Monitoring and Configurability**: Include logging and metrics to monitor rate-limiter performance and enable dynamic configuration of limits to adapt to changing traffic patterns or business needs.
