### Why one should prefer static factory methods over constructors in Java?

- Static factory methods have descriptive names (unlike anonymous constructors)

- They clearly communicate intent (e.g., `of()`, `valueOf()`, `getInstance()`)

- They can return cached, pre-existing, or singleton instances

- They avoid creating unnecessary new objects every time

- They can return subtypes or completely different implementations

- They hide implementation classes from clients

- They enable flyweight, immutable, or canonicalized objects

- They support multiple creation patterns with the same parameter types

- They reduce verbosity for parameterized types (especially pre-diamond operator)

- They form the foundation of modern APIs (List.of, Optional.of, etc.)

- They allow better naming than overloaded constructors

- Constructors are still fine for very simple mandatory new-instance cases

- Use static factories by default unless you specifically need subclassing

- They make code more flexible, readable, performant, and idiomatic
