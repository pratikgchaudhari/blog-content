### Spring AI

- Spring AI is a framework by Spring to integrate AI capabilities into Java applications, focusing on ease of use and extensibility.
- Enables developers to embed AI models (e.g., LLMs, embeddings) into Spring-based apps for tasks like text generation, classification, or semantic search.
- Supports various AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, Azure AI) via a unified API.
- Provides a consistent interface for different AI providers, simplifying model swapping.
- Offers tools for crafting, managing, and optimizing AI prompts.
- Facilitates vector embeddings for tasks like similarity search or RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
- Seamlessly works with Spring Boot for rapid development and configuration.
- Allows custom AI model integrations and fine-tuning.
- Includes an AI Client as the core interface for interacting with AI models.
- Provides Prompt Templates to simplify dynamic prompt creation.
- Integrates with vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) for embedding storage and retrieval.
- Supports use cases like chatbots, content generation, semantic search, data analysis, and intelligent workflows.
- Reduces complexity, leverages Springâ€™s ecosystem, supports rapid prototyping, and ensures scalability.
