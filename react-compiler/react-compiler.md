### React Compiler

- **React Compiler**: A tool that optimizes React applications by automatically memoizing components and hooks to reduce unnecessary re-renders.
- **Purpose**: Enhances performance by analyzing code and applying optimizations like memoization without manual intervention.
- **Key Feature - Memoization**: Automatically wraps components and hooks (e.g., `useMemo`, `useCallback`) to prevent redundant computations.
- **Static Analysis**: Analyzes component code at build time to understand data flow and dependencies.
- **Automatic Optimization**: Eliminates need for developers to manually add `React.memo`, `useMemo`, or `useCallback`.
- **Granular Updates**: Ensures only changed parts of the UI re-render, improving efficiency.
- **Integration**: Works as a Babel plugin or part of frameworks like Next.js, compatible with existing React code.
- **Rules of React Compliance**: Maintains React’s rendering model and avoids breaking component lifecycle or state logic.
- **Limitations**: May not optimize dynamic or complex dependency patterns; requires clean, predictable code for best results.
- **Availability**: Experimental in React 19, with broader adoption in tools like Create React App and Next.js.
