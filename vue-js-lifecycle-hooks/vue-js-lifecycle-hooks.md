### Vue.js Lifecycle Hooks

beforeCreate: Called immediately after instance initialization, before data observation and event/watcher setup.
created: Called after the instance is created, with data observation, computed properties, methods, and watchers set up, but before DOM mounting.
beforeMount: Called before the component is mounted to the DOM, after the template is compiled.
mounted: Called after the component is mounted to the DOM, with the element fully rendered and accessible.
beforeUpdate: Called when reactive data changes, before the DOM is re-rendered and patched.
updated: Called after the DOM has been updated due to reactive data changes.
beforeUnmount: Called before a component is unmounted, allowing cleanup tasks while the component is still fully functional.
unmounted: Called after the component is unmounted and destroyed, with all directives, listeners, and resources cleaned up.
errorCaptured: Called when an error from a descendant component is captured, allowing error handling (receives error, instance, and info).
renderTracked: Called when a reactive dependency is tracked during rendering, useful for debugging (receives debugger event).
renderTriggered: Called when a render is triggered by a reactive dependency change, useful for debugging (receives debugger event).
activated: Called when a component inside `<KeepAlive>` is activated (re-displayed from cache).
deactivated: Called when a component inside `<KeepAlive>` is deactivated (cached but not destroyed).
serverPrefetch (SSR only): Called on the server before rendering to prefetch data for server-side rendering.
