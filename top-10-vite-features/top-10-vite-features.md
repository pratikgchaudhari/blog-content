### Top 10 Vite Features

1. > **Lightning-Fast Cold Start**: Vite leverages native ES modules in the browser for on-demand file serving, eliminating the need for bundling during development, resulting in near-instant server startup times.

2. > **Ultra-Fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Provides instant updates to modules without full page reloads, maintaining application state and scaling efficiently even for large apps.

3. > **High-Performance Pre-Bundling with esbuild**: Dependencies from node_modules are pre-bundled using esbuild, a Go-based tool that's 10-100x faster than traditional JavaScript bundlers, handling formats like ESM and CommonJS seamlessly.

4. > **Optimized Production Builds with Rollup**: Uses Rollup for final bundling, enabling advanced optimizations like tree-shaking and code splitting to produce lean, performant assets.

5. > **Rich Plugin Ecosystem**: Extensible via a simple plugin API compatible with hundreds of Rollup plugins, allowing easy integration of features like PWA support or image optimization.

6. > **Out-of-the-Box TypeScript Support**: Handles TypeScript natively with fast transpilation via esbuild, including full HMR for .ts files without additional configuration.

7. > **Built-in CSS Support**: Processes CSS with PostCSS, Sass, and Less out of the box, including features like CSS Modules, preprocessor injection, and fast HMR for styles.

8. > **Framework-Agnostic with Official Integrations**: Works seamlessly with Vue (SFC support), React (Fast Refresh), Svelte, Preact, and others through dedicated plugins for optimal DX.

9. > **Advanced Asset Handling**: Supports dynamic imports, glob imports for file patterns, and optimized handling of images, fonts, and even WebAssembly (.wasm) files.

10. > **Future-Proof Modern Defaults**: Assumes modern browsers (esnext target) to minimize transpilation, while providing sensible defaults for legacy support, security (CSP headers), and scalability.
