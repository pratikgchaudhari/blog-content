### Want a Faster Java Program? Meet Epsilon GC (and Its Dangerous Trade-Offs)

Ever wondered how much faster your Java program could run without a Garbage Collector (GC)? We're talking 30 to 50 percent faster. Seriously.

The GC, while crucial to the JVM, drains your program's compute and memory resources, slowing it down. That’s why languages like C, C++, and Rust, which don't have a GC, often outperform Java.

But let's face it, coding in those languages isn't for the faint-hearted. Manual memory management is a deep, dark rabbit hole.

Curious about how your program would perform without the GC constantly tripping it up? Want to see how much memory it really uses?

Meet **Epsilon GC**.

What the heck is Epsilon GC?

Introduced in **Java 11**, Epsilon GC liberates your code from garbage collection by... not doing it at all. It just allocates memory without reclaiming it.

Yes, you heard that right.

Epsilon GC barely uses any extra CPU or memory, aside from what’s needed to allocate new memory. This can give your program a significant boost.

Think of it as giving your code the power of Thanos’ Infinity Stones—if it can handle them. But be warned: your program might end up like Tony Stark, achieving greatness only to crash and burn.

So, what’s the real use case for Epsilon GC? It's for code designed to produce zero garbage—no small feat. Think Log4J.

However, using Epsilon GC in production is risky. Even with optimized code, you’re playing with fire.

Imagine yourself as Tony Stark: wield the power briefly, save the day, but with a high chance of burning out.

Next time you want to test your program’s performance without garbage collection and don’t mind seeing it crash, you know which GC to choose.
