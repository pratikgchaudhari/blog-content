### Virtual Threads in Java:
- Virtual threads are lightweight, JVM-managed threads introduced in Java 21 (JEP 444) to simplify concurrent programming.
- Enable high-throughput, scalable applications by reducing overhead of traditional OS threads.
- Lightweight: Thousands to millions can run on a single JVM, unlike heavy OS threads.
- Managed by JVM: Not tied to OS threads; JVM schedules them on a smaller pool of carrier threads.
- Non-blocking: Automatically yield during blocking operations (e.g., I/O), improving resource utilization.
- Compatibility: Work seamlessly with existing Java code, APIs, and tools like Thread API.
- Ideal for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., web servers, database queries) but less suited for CPU-bound tasks.
- Simplifies concurrency: Write straightforward, sequential-style code without complex async frameworks.
- High scalability: Supports massive concurrency with low memory and CPU overhead.
- No need for thread pooling: Virtual threads are cheap to create and destroy.
- Not ideal for long-running, CPU-intensive tasks (use platform threads instead).
- Built on Project Loom, using continuations to pause/resume execution efficiently.
- Standard in Java 21+; no external libraries needed.
