### Flexible Constructor Bodies in Java 25

- Flexible constructor bodies, introduced as a standard feature in Java 25 via JEP 513, relax the historical requirement that a constructor must start with an explicit invocation of another constructor (super() or this()). This allows statements to appear before such invocations, enabling more natural and safer object initialization while maintaining top-down construction semantics.
- The constructor body is divided into a prologue (statements before the explicit constructor invocation) and an epilogue (statements after). The prologue can include safe computations or initializations, but the epilogue handles the rest of the initialization after the superclass or sibling constructor has run.
- Statements in the prologue can perform computations on constructor arguments (e.g., validation, sanitization, or deriving values), initialize uninitialized fields declared in the same class, or execute other code that does not reference the instance being constructed (no use of 'this' implicitly or explicitly, except for field assignments).
- Prologue code cannot read or access any instance fields (local or superclass), call instance methods, or reference the object under construction to prevent observing partially initialized states. This ensures safe execution even if overridable methods are called from the superclass constructor.
- Enables early parameter validation before superclass delegation (e.g., throwing exceptions on invalid inputs), field initialization to avoid default values visible to superclass code, and preparation of complex arguments, reducing bugs from overriding methods and improving code readability without needing static helper methods or patterns like telescoping constructors.
- The JVM has long supported this flexibility for compiler-generated code (e.g., inner classes), but the Java Language Specification was stricter until now; no JVM changes are needed, only language spec updates. It's foundational for Project Valhalla features like value classes, where implicit invocations may appear at the end.
- As a significant syntax change, tools like IDEs, linters, and analyzers may require updates to handle prologues correctly, potentially causing temporary compatibility issues during migration.
