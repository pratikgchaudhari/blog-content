### Key Features of Executor Framework in Java

- **Thread Pool Management**: Efficiently manages a pool of threads to execute tasks, reducing thread creation overhead.
- **Task Submission**: Supports submitting tasks (Runnable or Callable) for asynchronous execution.
- **Task Scheduling**: Provides ScheduledExecutorService for scheduling tasks to run after a delay or periodically.
- **Thread Safety**: Ensures thread-safe task submission and execution.
- **Task Result Retrieval**: Supports Callable tasks to return results and handle exceptions via Future objects.
- **Task Cancellation**: Allows cancellation of submitted tasks and checking their completion status.
- **Executor Types**: Offers various executor types (e.g., fixed thread pool, cached thread pool, single-threaded executor) for different use cases.
- **Shutdown Control**: Provides methods to gracefully shut down the executor, allowing tasks to complete or terminate immediately.
- **Work Stealing**: Supports ForkJoinPool for work-stealing algorithms, optimizing task distribution.
- **Exception Handling**: Facilitates handling of exceptions thrown by tasks through Future or custom mechanisms.
- **Task Prioritization**: Allows custom thread pools with priority-based task execution.
- **Scalability**: Optimizes resource usage for high-concurrency applications by reusing threads.
